## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed to look calm and clear in shades of green. 

### Colour
For the colour scheme green tones were selected by coolers.co.

Afterwards I used ColorSpace to select a matching pallete. To see what contrast matches best I used Eightshapes.

### Fonts
Raleway was imported from google fonts.

### Structure
The page is structured in a well know, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. Upon arriving to the website, the user has 2 options to play again or look at the scoreboard.
The website consists of 4 separate pages: 
- A homepage with the option to look at the scores or play the game
- A quiz page where you can play the game
- An end page where you can play again or save you score/name 
- A page with the highscores and names
